have fun kongz...runs p2k for you

CHARMZ SUPPORT HAS BEEN REMOVED. 
Because you are now able to add as many charmz as you want at a time, apply them via UI before running it.

Runs batches of 25 at a time, and then will finish any remaining runs (30 runs = batch of 25 then batch of 5).
After doing the runs, it waits for chainlink and then finalizes the runs.

THIS WILL OVERPAY FOR GAS. I didnt feel like figuring it out at time of run, so I just defaulted to the same number. Thankfully, its matic chain so it does not really matter.

make sure you approve bananas. best option is go start a run via UI, and it will have you approve them

feel free to share this where ever, i dont particularly care...just tell them you got it from me

the only assurance i give on this code is that its not malicious, use at your own risk
